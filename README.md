# Esports-Discord-Bot


The Esports room for the school was not fully set-up at the time. Students would have to go to the head of the sports team to ask for the key to the room. The only way to ask who had the key would be to go on discord and wait until someone replies. With this bot, it is a lot easier to no only keep track of who has the key, request to get the key from that person but also find out who is inside the room so that team members could know if they have anyone to practice with.
